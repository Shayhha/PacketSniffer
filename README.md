# Packet Sniffer

## Overview

Packet Sniffer is a powerful network packet analysis tool built with a user-friendly GUI using PyQt and advanced packet capturing techniques using Scapy. It enables you to capture, examine, and analyze different types of network packets. The application currently supports seven packet types: TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, TLS, ICMP, ARP, and STP. It also provides insightful details about packets containing IP layers and other packet specific parameters that you can analyze further.

## Clone Repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Shayhha/PacketSniffer.git
```

## Features

- Captures, analyzes, and visualizes network packets.
- Supports packet types: TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, TLS, ICMP, ARP, and STP.
- Enables user to search packets by type, port and IP address.
- Provides detailed packet information including IP layers.
- Utilizes a clean and intuitive GUI developed with PyQt5.
- Enables users to save scan results as a TXT file or PCAP file for further analysis.
- Leverages Scapy, a Python library for network packet manipulation.

## Usage

1. Launch the Packet Sniffer application using the steps above.
2. Configure your network interface and packet filtering preferences.
3. Click the "Start Scan" button to begin packet capture.
4. Monitor captured packets in real-time through the intuitive GUI.
5. Save the scan results as a TXT file for offline analysis.

### Packet Filtering

- Specify a desired network interface to sniff from the available network interfaces.
- Customize packet filtering by selecting the packet types of interest (TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, TLS, ICMP, ARP, STP).
- Define additional filters such as specific IP addresses, ports, and more.

### Real-time Monitoring

- Once the scan is started, captured packets will be displayed in the GUI.
- The application provides insightful details about each packet, including its type, source, destination, and payload.

### Save Scan Results

- After the scan, click the "Save Scan" button to export the captured packet details to a TXT file or PCAP file.
- This allows for offline analysis and sharing of scan results with others.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- PyQt5
- Scapy

You can easily install these dependencies using the following commands:

```bash
pip install PyQt5
pip install scapy
```

**Important:** On Windows based systems  [Npcap](https://npcap.com/#download) must be installed to enable packet analysis and capturing.
